# Me in Markdown

## Introduction
My name is Samuel Kovler and I am currently in 10th grade.

My favorite book is either Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton or Blood Meridean by Cormac McCarthy. I like these books because they are immersive and thrilling, and have great, well structured stories. 

My favorite movie is Tropic Thunder. I find it very funny with great acting performances by the stars, especially Robert Downey Jr.

Something new I learned was understanding why time slows down as you approach light speed. I am still working to understand it better.

A recent achievement I have is making varsity basketball at Chatsworth. 

One fun fact about me is that I like learning about dinosaurs.

This school year, I hope to get all A's and pass every AP test with at least a 4.

This summer, I went to Cancun, Mexico with my family. We went snorkeling, kayaking, travelled to Xcaret and ate very good food.

My favorite dish this summer was Mulberry Street Pizza. I went to eat there with my family, and it is the best pizza I have ever had 100%.

In this class, I hope to become a seasoned and strong coder and further understand how computer programs function.

The most memorable experience I had this summer was getting my Kobe 6 Total Orange shoes. I had been waiting for them for weeks and was very excited when they came.

I have no recent tech-related projects. I did manage to fix my TV remotes' microphone, however, which had not been working. 

I currently participate in basketball and track and field at Chatsworth, and over the summer I ran, swam, played basketball, threw the football, and more. 

One creative endeavour I partake in is making homemade cards for my loved ones on their birthdays or holidays. I often draw images of things each respective person likes or make funny drawings using cut out pictures of them. 

I did no community service or volunteer work. 

I did not take part in any family traditions. 

This summer, my favorite memomory with my friends was being at the pool with all my club basketball teammates and our families in Vegas. We were there for a tournament, and we had a great time. We were all in the hot tub talking about games and life and whatnot. Truly a joyous and memorable experience.

Because I love to read and to learn, I wish to be in a field that requires me to bring, utilize, and expand my knowledge.
