# Me in Markdown

## Introduction
My name is Samuel Kovler and I am currently in 10th grade.

My favorite book is either Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton or Blood Meridean by Cormac McCarthy. I like these books because they are immersive and thrilling, and have great, well structured stories. 

My favorite movie is Tropic Thunder. I find it very funny with great acting performances by the stars, especially Robert Downey Jr.

Something new I learned was understanding why time slows down as you approach light speed. I am still working to understand it better.

A recent achievement I have is making varsity basketball at Chatsworth. 

One fun fact about me is that I like learning about dinosaurs.

This school year, I hope to get all A's and pass every AP test with at least a 4.

This summer, I went to Cancun, Mexico with my family. We went snorkeling, kayaking, travelled to Xcaret and ate very good food.

My favorite dish this summer was Mulberry Street Pizza. I went to eat there with my family, and it is the best pizza I have ever had 100%.

In this class, I hope to become a seasoned and strong coder
